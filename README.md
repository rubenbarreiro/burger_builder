This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Burger Builder
Burger builder for udemy course. <br />There is nothing fancy going on here, I just wanted to have this on github for working on it in my computers without too much hassle, and who knows, maybe some recruiter may want to look at my repos.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**Update**: Removed some stuff from this readme, yes create-react-app is cool but that massive readme is not something that I want to have
